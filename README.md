**Prerequisites:**

- **Node.js (v18.x or v20.x):** [https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) (Ensure you have an LTS version for stability)
- **Yarn (package manager):** [https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) (If not already installed, run `npm install -g yarn` in your terminal)
- **Code Editor:** Choose your preferred editor like Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, or Atom.

**Optional VSCode Extensions (Enhance Development Experience):**

1. **GraphQL:** Improves GraphQL syntax highlighting and autocompletion.
2. **ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets:** Speeds up coding with pre-written code snippets for modern JavaScript features and React patterns.
3. **Tailwind CSS Intellisense:** Provides intelligent code completion and suggestions for Tailwind CSS classes.
4. **Prettier:** Auto-formats your code for consistent formatting and readability.

**Steps:**

1. **Create Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   mkdir my-strapi-nextjs-app
   cd my-strapi-nextjs-app
   ```

2. **Install Strapi CMS:**

   ```bash
   npx create-strapi-app@latest my-cms-app
   ```

   - Replace `my-cms-app` with your desired application name.
   - This command creates a new Strapi project with the specified name and installs the necessary dependencies.

3. **Start Strapi Development Server:**

   - Navigate to the Strapi project directory:

     ```bash
     cd my-cms-app
     ```

   - Start the Strapi development server:

     ```bash
     npm run develop
     ```

   - Open `http://localhost:1337/admin` in your web browser to access the Strapi admin panel. You'll need to create an admin user to manage your content.

4. **Create Next.js Application:**

   - Navigate back to the main project directory:

     ```bash
     cd ..
     ```

   - Create a new Next.js application using Yarn:

     ```bash
     npx create-next-app@14.1.4
     ```
      ***It should show something like this***
     ```bash
      What is your project named? my-app (decide on your app name)
      Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes (The project is in JavaScript so choose No but if you know TypeScript you can choose Yes )
      Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes (Choose Yes)
      Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes (Choose Yes)
      Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes (Could be Yes or No, depends on your preference)
      Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes (Choose Yes)
      Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes (Choose No)
      What import alias would you like configured? @/*
     ```

   - This command generates a basic Next.js project structure.

5. **Install Additional Dependencies (Optional):**

   - If you plan to use GraphQL with your Next.js app to fetch data from Strapi, install the necessary dependencies in the `nextjs-app` directory:

     ```bash
     cd nextjs-app
     yarn add @apollo/client @apollo/client/next
     ```

6. **Connect Next.js App to Strapi (Next Steps):**

   - **Define Content Models:** In the Strapi admin panel, create content models to define the structure of your data (e.g., posts, articles, products).
   - **Set Up API Routes:** Configure Strapi to expose your content models as RESTful API endpoints that your Next.js app can interact with. Refer to the Strapi documentation for details.
   - **Fetch Data in Next.js:** In your Next.js app, use the `Apollo Client` (or other methods) to fetch data from the Strapi API endpoints and display it on your pages.

**Additional Tips:**

- Customize your Next.js app to suit your project's needs by adding components, pages, and styles as required.
- Explore the Strapi documentation for in-depth configuration options and advanced features: [https://docs.strapi.io/](https://docs.strapi.io/)

By following these comprehensive steps and customizing them to your specific project requirements, you'll have a solid foundation for building powerful and dynamic applications with Strapi and Next.js!
